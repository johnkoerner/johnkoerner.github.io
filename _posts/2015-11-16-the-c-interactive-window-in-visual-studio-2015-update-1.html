<p>The next update of Visual Studio 2015 will contain the C# interactive window. This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> that allows you to execute C# code. To access this, open the <code>View=&gt;Other Windows=&gt;C# Interactive</code> menu item.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnkoerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/C-Interactive-Menu.png" alt="C# Interactive Menu" width="544" height="695" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1485" /></p>
<p>Now that you have the window open, the first thing you should do is read the help, so you get the lay of the land. Type <code>#help</code> to get a list of commands. Here you can see some of the keyboard shortcuts for moving between various submissions and some commands to clear (<code>#cls</code>) and reset the window (<code>#reset</code>). Note that as of the current release candidate I am experiencing some issues with the arrow keys not behaving as described.</p>
<p>Now you can start typing valid C# code and it will be evaluated in the window. For example, I could type the following:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; var x = 1;
&gt; x = x + 1;
&gt; x++;
</code></pre>
<p>Each of these statements are evaluated and the value of <code>x</code> is maintained as it is mutated by these commands. Finally, I can type <code>x</code> and hit <code>Ctrl-Enter</code> or <code>Enter</code> twice to evaluate the value of <code>x</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; x
3
</code></pre>
<p>You can also declare <code>using</code> statements inside the interactive window and then have access to all the members in the namespace.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; using System.Threading;
&gt; Thread.Sleep(500);
</code></pre>
<p>You can declare functions inside the REPL by simply typing or pasting the function into the window.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; public int AddNumbers(int x, int y)
. {
.     return x + y;
. }
&gt; AddNumbers(5,6)
11
</code></pre>
<p>If you need to load another DLL into the REPL, you can do that using the <code>#r</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; #r "Z:\Dev\ConsoleApplication29\bin\Debug\ConsoleApplication29.exe"
&gt; using ConsoleApplication29;
&gt; var x = new Something();
&gt; x.DoSomething();
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see it is very easy to get going quickly with the C# interactive window and it provides you a quick way of prototyping your C# code. The REPL is used heavily in F# development and I think C# developers will find great ways to leverage it as part of their development workflows.</p>
