<p>My team was recently working on our installer when we ran into a return code from one of our pre-requisites (specifically the Visual C++ 2015 Runtime). From the logs, we found the error code was 0x80070666 and the return code was 0x666 (a newer version of the runtime was installed). We could easily handle this scenario, but we were looking to find an extensive list of return codes for the C++ redistributables and could not easily find them. Eventually we ran across the list of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa376931(v=vs.85).aspx">MsiExec.exe and InstMsi.exe Error Messages</a> and figured out why our searches were yielding no results. The error codes in the log files are all in hex and the error codes on the website are all in decimal. So, to help others with this in the future, here is a list of all of the error codes from that link with their hex equivalent.</p>

<p>Any installer that uses standard MSI technology will likely use these same error codes(i.e the Microsoft C++ redistributables (vcredist_x86.exe, vcredist_x64.exe)).</p>
