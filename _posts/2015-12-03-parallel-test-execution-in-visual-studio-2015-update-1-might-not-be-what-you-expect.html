<p>In the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2015-update1-vs.aspx">Update 1</a> of Visual Studio 2015, it was announced that MSTest will support running unit tests in parallel. I decided to give this a shot and see exactly how it worked. I started by writing 8 unit tests that all looked like this:</p>
<pre><code>[TestMethod]
public async Task TestMethod7()
{
    Console.WriteLine("1");
    await Task.Delay(5000);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Next, I added the RunSettings file to my project with a MaxCpuCount of 6:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?&gt;
&lt;RunSettings&gt;
  &lt;RunConfiguration&gt;
    &lt;MaxCpuCount&gt;6&lt;/MaxCpuCount&gt;
  &lt;/RunConfiguration&gt;
&lt;/RunSettings&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, I selected my run settings file from the Test Settings Menu:</p>
<p><img src="/content/SelectTestSettings.png" alt="SelectTestSettings" width="546" height="225" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1502" /></p>
<p>I ran it and all of my tests still ran in serial. I thought maybe I had done something wrong or perhaps hit a bug with the new feature, so I returned to the update 1 announcement and found my answer. It states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Parallel test execution leverages the available cores on the machine, and is realized by launching the test execution engine on each available core as a distinct process, and <strong>handing it a container (assembly, DLL, or relevant artifact containing the tests to execute)</strong>, worth of tests to execute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The separate container bit is the piece I was missing. In order to get my tests to run in parallel, I needed to split up my tests into separate test assemblies. After doing that, I saw that the tests in different assemblies were running in parallel.</p>
<p>The distinction of tests running in parallel across assemblies is a subtle point that may cause confusion if you think just setting the MaxCpuCount in a run settings file is going to give you benefit on a single test assembly. Overall, I am glad to see that Microsoft is still improving MSTest and hopefully they continue to add features that will allow us to better parallelize our testing.</p>
<p><strong>Update (2016-06-15)</strong> - I create a sample set of tests on <a href="https://github.com/johnkoerner/VS2015ParallelUnitTests">GitHub</a> to better demonstrate this functionality.</p>
