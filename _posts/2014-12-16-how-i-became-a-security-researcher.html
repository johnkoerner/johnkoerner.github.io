<p>To be clear, I don't consider myself a security researcher, rather I am a programmer who happens to dabble in security research. Maybe this is a little bit of <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImAPhonyAreYou.aspx">imposter syndrome</a> kicking in, but I really think I just know enough to be dangerous.</p>
<p>A few months back I learned of the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn800983.aspx">Online Services Bug Bounty</a> program Microsoft was offering. I decided to give it a go. I am always looking for authorized hacking opportunities and really wasn't expecting anything to come of it. I created my test tenants and started playing around. I decided to focus on XSS vulnerabilities, as that is something I am pretty comfortable with and is pretty easy to test client side. Whenever I have tested for XSS vulnerabilities, I have always found that dialog windows tend to be some of the biggest culprits, so I honed in on those in my test tenant.</p>
<p>Eventually I stumbled across an OWA dialog that wasn't escaping strings. I was easily able to generate this (URLs hidden to protect the innocent):</p>
<p><img alt='' class='alignnone size-full wp-image-959' src='https://johnkoerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/img_548fac4a5d9a0.png' /></p>
<p>And then with a little more tweaking, this:</p>

<p>It was clear I had found an XSS vulnerability. I followed the submission instructions on the bug bounty page and waited to hear back. Within a few days, I got an email from the Microsoft security team indicating they had forwarded the bug to the product team. About a week after that I received confirmation that the product team had reproduced the bug and were working on a fix. Here is the timeline for the fix:</p>
<pre><code>Oct. 9 (Thursday)   - Reported Bug
Oct. 13 (Monday)    - Microsoft confirmed receipt of bug 
Oct. 21 (Tuesday)   - Product team confirms repro of bug
Oct. 29 (Wednesday) - Product team confirmed that bug exists in boxed products
Dec. 9 (Tuesday)    - Official security bulletin released.
</code></pre>
<p>Since this bug impacted user installed versions of exchange, it took a bit longer for the product team to fix. I didn't continuously test the online URL to know exactly when it was fixed, but I know as of today the vulnerability is fixed.</p>
<p>The bulletin for the bug is <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms14-075">MS14-075</a>.</p>
<p>The Microsoft team has credited me for this fix in multiple locations:</p>
