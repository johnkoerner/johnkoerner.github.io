<p>I was building dot net core console applications on OSX and ran into an issue where certain core dependencies were not resolving when running <code>dnu build</code>. The error output I would get would be:</p>
<pre><code>Building ConsoleApplication2 for DNX,Version=v4.5.1
  Using Project dependency ConsoleApplication2 1.0.0
    Source: /Users/john/Dev/ConsoleApplication2/project.json

  Unable to resolve dependency fx/mscorlib

  Unable to resolve dependency fx/System

  Unable to resolve dependency fx/System.Core

  Unable to resolve dependency fx/Microsoft.CSharp
  ...
</code></pre>
<p>After doing some testing, I found that if I specified the core framework (dnxcore50) to the build command, then it would work properly.</p>
<pre><code>dnu build --framework dnxcore50
</code></pre>
<p>After doing some more digging, I found that I did not have the mono framework installed on the machine, and thus the v4.5.1 build was failing. To correct this, I simply had to install the mono framework using <code>dnvm</code>:</p>
<pre><code>dnvm upgrade -r mono
</code></pre>
<p>After that, the <code>dnu build</code> works properly and I can continue on my way.</p>
