<p><a href="https://johnkoerner.com/csharp/creating-your-first-code-analyzer/">Last time</a> we talked about the basics of creating an analyzer. Now that we have some working code, let's tweak it a bit. We're going start by fixing a small issue with the default code to update it to handle partial classes.</p>
<p>Let's look for a minute at how our current analyzer handles partial classes. I created a file with the partial class <code>Foo</code> declared multiple times. As you see, it only reports the diagnostic on one of the two declared instances.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnkoerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/PartialClass.png" alt="PartialClass" width="634" height="286" class="size-full wp-image-1090" /></p>
<p>Looking into the analyzer code, its pretty easy to see why. If you look at the <code>AnalyzeSymbol</code> method, when the diagnostic is created, it uses the first location to report the diagnostic.</p>
<pre><code>private static void AnalyzeSymbol(SymbolAnalysisContext context)
{
    // TODO: Replace the following code with your own analysis, generating Diagnostic objects for any issues you find
    var namedTypeSymbol = (INamedTypeSymbol)context.Symbol;

    // Find just those named type symbols with names containing lowercase letters.
    if (namedTypeSymbol.Name.ToCharArray().Any(char.IsLower))
    {
        // For all such symbols, produce a diagnostic.
        var diagnostic = Diagnostic.Create(Rule, namedTypeSymbol.Locations[0], namedTypeSymbol.Name);

        context.ReportDiagnostic(diagnostic);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>Locations</code> is an <code>ImmutableArray</code> of <code>Location</code>, we can simply iterate over that and report all of the diagnostics for this symbol.</p>
<pre><code>private static void AnalyzeSymbol(SymbolAnalysisContext context)
{
    // TODO: Replace the following code with your own analysis, generating Diagnostic objects for any issues you find
    var namedTypeSymbol = (INamedTypeSymbol)context.Symbol;

    // Find just those named type symbols with names containing lowercase letters.
    if (namedTypeSymbol.Name.ToCharArray().Any(char.IsLower))
    {
        foreach (var location in namedTypeSymbol.Locations)
        {
            // For all such symbols, produce a diagnostic.
            var diagnostic = Diagnostic.Create(Rule, location, namedTypeSymbol.Name);

            context.ReportDiagnostic(diagnostic);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Running the analyzer project again, you will now see that the diagnostic is reported on both of the declarations of the partial class.</p>

<p>The important lesson to take away here is that there are a lot of ways to do things in C# and when writing an analyzer you need to consider that. Partials are a crucial part of the framework and failing to account for them in your analyzer will leave a small, but sometimes annoying, hole in your analyzers coverage.</p>
