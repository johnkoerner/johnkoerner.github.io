12 - On-site Challenge
The flag for this challenge can only be found onsite at the conference, in the location seen on top of the backside of the elephant, in this picture.

When you arrive at CodeMash, find the code. Only attendees of CodeMash are eligible to win this competition, so don't share the code with anyone!

I have to admit, I spent more time on this one than I should have. I looked all around the elephant.  If you look more closely at the picture, there is a reflection.  Turning around I saw the flag (albeit with some clues from others):
