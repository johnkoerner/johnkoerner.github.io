<p>I am a big fan of using Code Analysis (formerly FXCop) in my Visual Studio projects to help catch issues. Recently I ran across a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/query/dev12.query?appId=Dev12IDEF1&amp;l=EN-US&amp;k=k%28CA2208%29;k%28TargetFrameworkMoniker-.NETFramework,Version%3Dv4.5.1%29&amp;rd=true">CA2208</a> warning that I needed to think about. Usually these are simple results of refactoring or forgetting to include the argument name in the ArgumentNullException or ArgumentOutOfRangeException. This one, however, was a little different. The value was passed to the exception constructor and the name was correct.</p>
<p>The following code reproduces the issue (note this is C# 6 code written in the VS 2015 Preview leveraging the new <code>nameof</code> keyword):</p>
<pre><code>private static void Foo(string bar, string baz)
{
    if (bar == null)
        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(bar));

    Task.Run(() =&gt;
    {
        if (baz == null)
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(baz));

    });
}
</code></pre>
<p>The reason being is that rule checks to make sure the name being passed to the constructor of the exception matches a parameter of the current method. However, the code that gets generated for the delegate doesn't pass <code>baz</code> as a parameter, rather it is a public field on the generated class. The code for the generated class essentially looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>[CompilerGenerated]
private sealed class &lt;&gt;c__DisplayClass0
{
    public string baz;
    internal void &lt;Foo&gt;b__1()
    {
        bool flag = this.baz == null;
        if (flag)
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException("baz");
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>So I have come to the conclusion to simply suppress this message for the time being. Hopefully with the new Roslyn analysis capabilities minor issues like these can be completely avoided.</p>
