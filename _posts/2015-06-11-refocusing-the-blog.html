<p>I have decided it is time for a refocus of this blog. I am going to post more often on a more focused set of topics. I have been interested in the new Roslyn code analysis features that are coming in Visual Studio 2015, so going forward you will see a lot more posts on topics surrounding code analysis and you will see them on a more regular basis. I have started contributing to the open source <a href="https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers">Style Cop Analyzers</a> project, as I feel that is a great way to learn more about this technology and I will share as much as I can on this blog.</p>
<p>To fully reap the benefits of this refocus, I have been following the methodology laid out by <a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com">John Sonmez</a> in his <a href="http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/">blogging course</a> and I feel it provides simple yet useful guidance on how to properly manage your blog. Heck, I even bought his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617292397/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1617292397&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=stratfor08-20&amp;linkId=A3M7CCTVX2JMLVAR">book</a>. If you haven't checked out the free blogging course, I encourage you to do so, maybe it will provide you the kick in the butt you need to get out there.</p>
